# studip-sync

A simple script that uses the studip REST api to sync files.  
It can be installed via pipx:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/tionis/studip_sync

```

> NOTE: The studip REST API will be deprecated soon as mentionend in #1

> NOTE: studip-sync does not handle file changes, as it only syncs based on the filename
