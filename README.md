# studip-sync

A simple script that uses the studip REST api to sync files.

> NOTE: The studip REST API will be deprecated soon as mentionend in #1

> NOTE: studip-sync does not probably not handle file changes, as it only syncs based on the filename

> NOTE: studip-sync is not ready yet, I translated this code from janet and haven't tested it yet. Most notable config loading is broken right now
